   <p> This is my first game I made in Scratch and I must Say I am pretty proud of my work. This is the first time I ever coded and it doest kind of get me interested to major in computer science. I made a ping pong game with an AI.</p>

	<p> I made a game in mit app inventor and I made a moll mash but named it diglet smash. Diglet smash is the game where you touch the moles that randomly spawn anywhere in the 
	the touch pad and each time you touch it a it vibrates and increases your score by one. You dont exactley win the game but the ultimate goal is 
	to have the highest score possible. It is an amzing expierence for me at least since I am not expierenced with coding.</p>
